# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

In this program, i built a simple SVG logo maker that allows the user to input text and choose a color, and the program generates an SVG logo image with the text in that color.

I didnt get my app to render a new SVG but i was able to get the shape examples to render.

I watched this youtube video to understand how to initially format my index and setting up examples/ how to show them.
